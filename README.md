Dynamic programming (usually referred to as DP ) is a very powerful technique to solve a particular class of 
problems. It demands very elegant formulation of the approach and simple thinking and the coding part is very easy.
The idea is very simple, If you have solved a problem with the given input, then save the result for future reference, 
so as to avoid solving the same problem again.. shortly 'Remember your Past' :) .  If the given problem can be 
broken up in to smaller sub-problems and these smaller subproblems are in turn divided in to still-smaller ones, 
and in this process, if you observe some over-lapping subproblems
